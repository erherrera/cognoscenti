# Library Folder
# This is an alternate (newer) way of saving project information
# in the Cognoscenti server.  Specify a list of lib folders (separated by
# semicolon) and the server will search that folder tree for project
# files.  Attachments are stored in the same folder with the project file
# only one project file per OS file folder allowed.
# Use can edit the attachment files directly, and re-synch later with
# project.  Each project is a folder, and much easier to access attachments.
#libFolder=c:/sanddata/coglib/
